This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

mw <- read.csv("data/midwest_bls_cpi.csv", skip = 3, header = TRUE) 
ne = read.csv("data/northeast_bls_cpi.csv", skip = 3, header = TRUE)
s = read.csv("data/south_bls_cpi.csv", skip = 3, header = TRUE)
w = read.csv("data/west_bls_cpi.csv", skip = 3, header = TRUE)
data = rbind(mw, ne, s, w)
area_codes = read.csv("data/area_codes.csv")
item_codes = read.csv("data/item_codes.csv", sep ="\t")

data_split <- data %>% 
  separate(
    col = 1,
    into = c("AP", "Seasonal Adjust", "Area", "Item"), 
    sep = c(2, 3, 7)
  ) %>% 
  merge(
    item_codes, by.x = "Item", by.y = "item_code"
  ) %>%
  merge(
    area_codes %>% select(-X), by.x = "Area", by.y = "area_code"
  )
data_item_codes <- data_split %>% 
  select("Item")

item_only <-  
  item_codes %>% 
  select(item_code)

intersection = unlist(item_only) %in% unlist(data_item_codes)
as.vector(unlist(data_item_codes)[intersection])

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
